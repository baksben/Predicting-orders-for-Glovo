# Forecasting order volumes for Glovo
The project is simplified to forecasting the number of orders for just one city. This involves two main steps:

** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) **: Load the file data_BCN.csv, explore and visualize the data. Look for trends, cycles, seasonalities, and any outliers or deviations from established patterns.

** Modelling**: Experiment with different models, validating each in a manner that imitates the real problem (i.e., every Sunday forecast all of the upcoming week). Be cautious of data leakage. Evaluate each model on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) to determine which performs better.
